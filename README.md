# React + Vite
# ChatApp using MERN Stack
This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create accounts, join chat rooms, and exchange messages in real-time.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
## Features

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages update instantly for all users in a chat room.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
## Technologies Used
